## How do I add a new repo to gee-community?

1. Create the repository elsewhere, such as under your personal account.
2. File a ticket [here](https://github.com/gee-community/github-administration/issues) asking to join the organization, including a link to the repository being added.
3. Accept the invitation to join the organization.
4. Use the GitHub UI to move the repository into the organization (you will need administrator/owner rights on the repository to do this). See [the GitHub documentation on repository transfer](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/transferring-a-repository) for details.
5. After it is moved, rename the repository as needed. Don't forget to update the documentation in the repository, too!
